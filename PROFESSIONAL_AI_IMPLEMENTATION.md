            issues: [],
            score: 0,
            suggestions: []
        };
        
        // Check for prohibited casual language
        this.prohibitedPatterns.forEach(pattern => {
            if (pattern.test(response)) {
                validation.isValid = false;
                validation.issues.push('Contains casual or unprofessional language');
            }
        });
        
        // Check for professional terminology
        const professionalTermCount = this.professionalIndicators
            .filter(term => response.toLowerCase().includes(term)).length;
        
        if (professionalTermCount < 3) {
            validation.issues.push('Lacks professional business terminology');
            validation.suggestions.push('Include more strategic business language and frameworks');
        }
        
        // Check response length and depth
        if (response.length < 800) {
            validation.issues.push('Response may be too brief for professional consultation');
            validation.suggestions.push('Provide more comprehensive analysis and actionable details');
        }
        
        // Check for actionable content
        const actionableKeywords = ['implement', 'execute', 'create', 'develop', 'establish', 'build'];

        // Calculate quality score
        validation.score = Math.max(0, 100 - (validation.issues.length * 20));
        
        return validation;
    }
    
    async enhanceResponse(originalResponse, validationResult) {

            const enhancedQuery = this.enhanceQueryForProfessionalResponse(userQuery, queryType);
            const selectedModel = this.determineModel(queryType, userQuery);
            
            let response = await this.executeWithRetry(() => 
                this.callModel(selectedModel, systemPrompt, enhancedQuery)
            );
            
            // Validate response quality
            const validationResult = validator.validateResponse(response.content);
            
            if (validationResult.isValid && validationResult.score >= 80) {

                // Low quality - try again with enhanced prompting
                console.warn(`Response quality score: ${validationResult.score}, attempting enhancement`);
                attempts++;
                continue;
            } else {
                // Final attempt - enhance the best response we got
                const enhancedContent = await validator.enhanceResponse(
                    response.content, 
                    validationResult

                };
            }
            
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempts === maxAttempts - 1) {
                throw error;
            }
            attempts++;
        }
    }
}

enhanceQueryForProfessionalResponse(userQuery, queryType) {
